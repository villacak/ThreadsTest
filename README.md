ThreadsTest
===========

Small Thread Application with comparative against Java single thread (standard).
With this app I show some of good practices when working with Threads in Java, 
like avoiding the stop that's deprecated and ti's been a while. How to implement 
a suspend, resume Thread and dealing with InterrupedException (this last isn't complete yet).
Also I have included in the ThreadsTest.java main class plenty comments to guide the user that 
want to implement some comparative tests running single thread process and muilti thread 
processces. Also it's quite easy to implement it using generics and implement more threads,
as in the code I've using just two. Give it a try and make it 4 or 6 if you are running in
processor that have multi core and hyper threading. Then you will be able to extract more
performance from your machine, just improving the code. No mentioning tweaking the JVM.
I hope that it helps you that is trying and needing to optmize your code, also feel free 
to branch it an improve the code.

Regards.
